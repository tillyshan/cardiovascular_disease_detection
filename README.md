# Project: cardiovascular diseases detection

**Description:**
Developed a machine learning model to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on a comprehensive dataset. 

 Business Requirement 1:
- Consider our client in a private hospital; their requirement is to identify all patients with the disease as accurately as possible. They are okay with some misidentifications regarding positive patients, as it does not pose a threat to the patients' lives.

 Business Requirement 2:
- Consider our client, an online medicine shop. They wish to offer a 50 percent discount on specific medicines to customers who have a disease. Their requirement is to send the discount offer via email only to customers with a disease.

 **Interactive APP:**
- Built an interactive web application using sreamlit framework.
- 


**Technologies and Libraries:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

**Key Steps:**
1. **Understand the Data:** Thoroughly analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Further analyzed data set using different charts, summaries. 
3. **Data cleaning:** Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data. Identified and removed outliers that could impact model performance.
4. **Data Preprocessing:** Applied feature scaling techniques to standardize feature values.Encoded categorical features for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.
6. **Model Evaluation:** Implemented logistic regression, linear SVM, random forest, and GaussianNB models.
7. **Ensemble Methods:** Utilized a hard voting classifier to combine the strengths of multiple models.
8. **Performance Comparison:** Compared the performance of different models based on various metrics.
9. **Model Selection:** Chose the best performing model.
10. **Hyper Parameter Tuning:** Further improve model performances by tuning hyper parameters.
11. **Test the model on unseen Data** Model was tested on test set
12. **Build eb Application** Build interactive web application using streamlit

### Model Selection and Web Application

After evaluating multiple machine learning models, the final model was selected based on its performance, with a focus on recall for the positive class, ensuring accurate identification of heart disease patients.

#### Best Model: [Logistic Regression]

To make the model accessible and user-friendly, a basic web application was created using the Streamlit library. The application allows users to input relevant data and get predictions regarding the likelihood of heart disease. It provides a basic user-friendly interface.

Please visit the [repository](https://github.com/tillyshan/Heart-Disease-detection/blob/main/web%20application.py) for the model.

### Usage
To run the Heart Disease Detection application, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tillyshan/Heart-Disease-detection.git
    ```

2.**Run the Application:** Start the application by running the following command in your Anaconda Prompt, Command Prompt, or PyCharm Terminal:

   ```bash
   streamlit run web application.py
   ```

3. **Access the Application:** Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (usually, it will be something like http://localhost:8501). You will see the user-friendly interface where you can enter your details.

Please note that the application is for demonstration and educational purposes.

### Future Enhancements
"The model achieves a 70% accuracy rate. Various models and model combinations can be employed to enhance performance."
