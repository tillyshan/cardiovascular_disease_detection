# Project: cardiovascular diseases detection

## Introduction
**What is Cardiovascular disease:**

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a term for problems related to the heart and blood vessels. It includes issues like heart attacks, heart failure, and problems with blood vessels. These can happen when things like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or smoking damage your heart or blood vessels. 

## Description:
Developed a machine learning model to predict the presence of cardiovascular disease in patients based on a comprehensive dataset. 

 Business Requirement 1:
- Consider our client in a private hospital; their requirement is to identify all patients with the disease as accurately as possible. They are okay with some misidentifications regarding positive patients, as it does not pose a threat to the patients' lives.

 Business Requirement 2:
- Consider our client, an online medicine shop. They wish to offer a 50 percent discount on specific medicines to customers who have a disease. Their requirement is to send the discount offer via email only to customers with a disease.

 **Interactive APP:**
- Built an interactive web application using sreamlit framework.

## Technologies and Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit

## Key Steps:

### Understand the Data:
Data set has 70,000 data points and 12 features.
<h4><font color='purple'>There are 3 types of input features:</font></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Objective: factual information;</li>
    <li>Examination: results of medical examination;</li>
    <li>Subjective: information given by the patient.</li>
</ul>

<h4><font color = 'purple'>Features:</font></h4>
<ul>
    <li>Age | Objective Feature | age | int (days)|</li>
    <li>Height | Objective Feature | height | int (cm) |</li>
    <li>Weight | Objective Feature | weight | float (kg) |</li>
    <li>Gender | Objective Feature | gender | categorical code |</li>
    <li>Systolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_hi | int |</li>
    <li>Diastolic blood pressure | Examination Feature | ap_lo | int |</li>
    <li>Cholesterol | Examination Feature | cholesterol | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |</li>
    <li>Glucose | Examination Feature | gluc | 1: normal, 2: above normal, 3: well above normal |</li>
    <li>Smoking | Subjective Feature | smoke | binary |</li>
    <li>Alcohol intake | Subjective Feature | alco | binary |</li>
    <li>Physical activity | Subjective Feature | active | binary |</li>
    <li>Presence or absence of cardiovascular disease | Target Variable | cardio | binary |</li>
</ul>

- **Systolic blood pressurepressure:** pressure during the heart's contraction or systole.
- **Diastolic blood pressure:** pressure when the heart is at rest or between beats during diastole.

### Exploratory Data Analysis:
Further analyzed data set using different charts, summaries.

### Data cleaning:
Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, duplicate entries, and inconsistent data. Identified and removed outliers that could impact model performance. When removing outliers for blood pressure values, consider the standards rather than a specific method for detecting outliers.

**Standards for Minimum and Maximum Values for Detecting Outliers in Diastolic Blood Pressure:**
**For Adults (18 and Older):**
- *Lower Limit:* 40 mmHg or lower
- *Upper Limit:* 110 mmHg or higher

**For Older Adults (65 and Older):**
- *Lower Limit:* 30 mmHg or lower
- *Upper Limit:* 100 mmHg or higher
or higher

**Standards for Minimum and Maximum Values for Detecting Outliers in Systolic Blood Pressure:**

**For Adults (18 Years and Older):**
- *Lower Limit:* 60 mmHg or lower
- *Upper Limit:* 220 mmHg or higher

**For Older Adults (65 Years and Older):**
- *Lower Limit:* 50 mmHg or lower
- *Upper Limit:* 200 mmHg or higher
or higheror higher

## Data Preprocessing:
Applied feature scaling techniques to standardize feature values.Encoded categorical features for compatibility with machine learning algorithms.

## Model Evaluationon Base line Scores:
Implemented logistic regression, linear SVM, random forest, and GaussianNB models.

## Try Ensemble Methods:
Utilized a hard voting classifier to combine the strengths of multiple models.

## Performance Comparison and model selection
Compared the performance of different models based on various metrics and Chose the best performing model.

## Hyper Parameter Tuning:
Further improve model performances by tuning hyper parameters. 

## Test the model on unseen Data
The model was tested on the test set. Check whether the model generalized well and evaluate its performance using various metrics.
